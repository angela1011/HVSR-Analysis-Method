# HVSR-Analysis-Method

About the raw data processing, 

HVSR was calculated by averaging the H/V obtained by dividing the signal into non-overlapping windows of 20 s in an hour. Each window was FF-transformed.

The calculation of HVSR curves involves averaging the Fourier amplitude spectra of the north-south (𝑁𝑆(𝜔)) and east-west (𝐸𝑊(𝜔)) components and dividing by the vertical component (𝑉(𝜔))
𝐻𝑉𝑆𝑅(𝜔) = √(𝑁𝑆(𝜔)2 + 𝐸𝑊(𝜔) 2) / 𝑉(𝜔) 

Smoothing type windows with a width equal to 20 % of the central frequency, 

plot it into the figure!
